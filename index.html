        <article>
          <p>The Color and Sound are a band from Boston; not <em>actually</em> Boston, it's just easier to say that.</p>
          <p>Ally, Joe, and Steve all went to high school together in a town that isn't actually Boston but close enough for them to say they're from Boston, because it's easier. Steve played in ska bands, Joe played in a pop punk cover band, and Ally played in an all-female band called The Ease. Joe joined The Ease, despite not being a teenage girl.</p>
          <p>They all were friends and liked each other, so they started a band called Life On Hold. Life on Hold was a band longer than most bands are bands. They played their version of pop punk around New England, winning people over and making friends.</p>
          <p>Nick and Chris also went to high school together, though several decades after the members of Life On Hold. They were also friends and liked each other, so they started a band of their own, called Emerson. They also played their version of pop punk around New England, winning some people over, and making a friend or two.</p>
          <p>Emerson and Life on Hold played a show together in the fall of 2011. They liked each other so much they stayed in touch, eventually having Chris join Life on Hold to help write and record what became their last record together.</p>
          <p>Eventually Life on Hold and Emerson, like most bands, had existed for too long. They had their last shows in Boston, although not actually Boston, it's just easier to say that. Everyone wanted to do something new, so Life on Hold stole Nick from Emerson and did something new.</p>
          <p>That something new was called The Color and Sound. They took some songs Steve and Chris wrote and recorded an EP called <em>The Spring Tour</em> in Steve's mom's garage, then toured with bands they liked like As The Sparrow and Modern Baseball and Pentimento.</p>
          <p>They recorded another EP in Steve's mom's garage, this time they called it Peace of Mind. It's hard to know what you're supposed to do and feel when you're in a band. The Color and Sound got anxious and stressed, like a lot of bands do, so they took a break. They traveled and were in other bands and stopped to smell the roses on their way to their jobs.</p>
          <p>Once the roses had been properly sniffed, The Color and Sound got back together to work on what became <em>hi. hi.</em> was fun to make. The Color and Sound watched Rick and Morty and drank fancy craft beer and spent a week in September of 2015 getting back into the swing of things and recording another EP. It was laid back and enjoyable and made The Color and Sound wonder why they took that silly break anyway.</p>
          <p>They toured down to Fest in Florida with Bob Nanna, making friends and observing billboards spelling out the ultimate sin of abortion along the way. They ripped gigs and shredded licks.</p>
          <p>They got back from Fest and didn't quite know what to do besides feel stressed and anxious again, so they took a break again. Being in a band is no fun if you're always worried you aren't having fun, you know? They traveled and were in other bands and stopped to smell the roses on their way to their jobs again.</p>
          <p>Then The Color and Sound remembered they had a backlog of 40+ demos from writing that they felt deserved to be heard. Steve had been slowly plucking away at new music while everyone took some time to get their shit together. Once the shit had been gathered and properly organized into a state of togetherness, The Color and Sound started practicing again, again.</p>
          <p>Now The Color and Sound find joy in working on new music, playing cool shows when they pop up, and finding the ultimate life/work/band balance from the comfort of their studio that's in Boston but not really, it's just easier to say that.</p>
